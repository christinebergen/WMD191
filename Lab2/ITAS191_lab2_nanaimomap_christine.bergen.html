            Gabriola Island, just a short 20 minute ferry ride from Nanaimo
            harbour is home to one of my favourite spots:
            <span class="placename">Descanso Bay Regional Park</span>.
            <span class="placename">Descanso Bay Regional Park</span> is
            situated just slightly north of the ferry terminal on Gabriola
            Island. <span class="placename">Descanso Bay</span> offers a
            year-round use campground, as well as a day use area that is popular
            for kayaking, paddle boarding, swimming, and beach combing on the
            sandstone shores. Various types of whales are often sighted passing
            by this location.

          <p>
            <span class="placename">Ammonite falls</span> is located on the
            north west side of Mount Benson, and is an impressive waterfall.
            There are various hiking trails that lead to
            <span class="placename">Ammonite falls</span>, but by far my
            favourite is the access off of Galloway Gulch. Round trip to the
            falls and back takes a little over an hour and is a great spot to
            take your dog off-leash. As always on Vancouver Island, extra care
            should be taken to be bear and cougar aware, as this is definitely
            their territory.

            <span class="placename">Neck point</span> is a city park located
            along Hammond Bay road.
            <span class="placename">Neck point</span> offers great hiking
            trails, and beautiful coastal and mountanin views. During the spring
            Herring Spawning every March,
            <span class="placename">Neck Point</span> is a great spot to watch
            the herring fishery boats and all of the sea lions and sea birds who
            also show up for a tasty treat.

            <span class="restaurant">The Crow and Gate Pub</span> is located in
            an area of south Nanaimo known as Yellow Point.
            <span class="restaurant">The Crow and Gate</span> has long been a
            fixture of the food culture in Nanaimo, bringing an authentic
            British Pub experience to the West Coast. Their pub fare is not
            unlike what you would find in a traditional pub in England, and they
            always have a great selection of UK beers on tap. By far the best
            thing about <span class="restaurant">The Crow and Gate pub</span>,
            is the Bread Pudding dessert which is only available in the winter
            months. <span class="restaurant">The Crow and Gate</span> also has
            an impressive garden/patio area that is open in the summer months.

          <p>
            <span class="restaurant">Drip Coffee</span> located across from
            Departure Bay Beach has become one of my favourite spots to unwind.
            With the breezy sea air on their patio, it's the perfect spot to
            meet a friend for coffee or a drink. Their avocado toast is second
            to none, and they also serve Island Farms ice cream for those hot
            summer days. Grab a coffee and head across the street to the beach
            and you can enjoy watching ferries coming and going and float planes
            taking off and landing.
