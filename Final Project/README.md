# ***ITAS 191 Final Project: Website*** #

**The link to my webpage: [Camping Luna](https://dev.itas.ca/~christine.bergen/ITAS191/FinalProject/)**

## ***Validation errors that I wasn't able to correct:***
- the *W3C validator* really doesn't like a trailing slash ```/>``` for some 
tags, but *prettier* tends to put them in. 

- There are some ID and label errors in my contact form. These are from the 
Bootstrap code that I used, and I didn' want to change them in case it changed
the functionality of the features of the form. If I had more time, I could 
spend some time testing to see if these could be fixed.

- The validator said that the ```<form>``` tag was unclosed, but the next error was a stray ```</form>``` tag. (??) 


## ***CSS Changes***
I tried to keep the theme consistent between the pages, with only changing the 
content and leaving the layout and background the same on each page. 
I changed: 
- font sizes 
- the font family 
- added quite a bit of margin and padding 
- I added links to Camping Luna's social media pages 

I had quite a bit of trouble getting the photos to display at the right size, and in the
right position. To solve this, I ended up having to make sure that all of the photos were
approximately the same size, and same orientation. I hope to learn more about how to 
make any size photo fit into the space I give it.

## ***Further content I would have liked to add:***
- I would have liked to add some more photos in a more complicated format other
than the carousel. 
 
- It would be nice to have some more information on the prices of 
the various services that the campground offers.

- I also would have liked to add some sort of google maps add-on that would pinpoint 
the location of Camping Luna.

- I'd like the form to automatically forward to a specified email address. For now, it 
gives an output on the dev server page.

## ***How I chose the colours for my page***
- I used one of the main photos of the beach and ran it through the colour picker on 
color.adobe.com. 

- The main background colour resembles the ocean and the yellow at the bottom of 
the page resembles the sun. 

- I ran my colour choices past my in-house colourblindness checker as well (my husband!).

## ***If I had more time...***
- The nav bar was a bit problematic. I couldn't seem to add padding between the 
page titles. If I had more time, I would have taken a deeper dive into the nav items
in the nav bar to space them out a bit better. I suspect that the Bootstrap CSS file
that was linked to my page probably had something to do with this.

-This website was created for a friend of mine who moved to Nicaragua a few years 
ago and runs Camping Luna with her boyfriend. I may have to tweak it a bit to her 
preference to actually post it, but I expect that it will be live very soon to help 
Camping Luna with it's online presence!
